An online betting calculator using Vue.js, a Webpack build system and pre-render plugin to be SEO friendly, this became the second most traffic intensive page on the client's site.

This project posed a number of challenges including being able to generate links to a user's saved bets, as well as the tech stack in question being used to primarily do complex calculations with numbers.

In order to get this working correctly, we had to look at alternative methods to regular JavaScript expressions when calculating numbers.

The underlying calculation engine used a number of different libraries in order to generate accurate calculations. This was made more complex by the number of options available to the user when creating a bet which could drastically change the outcome of these calculations.

In terms of traffic, we discovered that the users were mainly on mobile. Design-wise, we wanted to enable mobile users to have the same flexibility in terms of calculating bets on their phone so we went through a number of iterations to ensure a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile.

The project was an overwhelming success for the client in terms of driving traffic through to their main site, as well as increasing their SEO visibility across many of the main betting categories.

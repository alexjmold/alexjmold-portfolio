A highly animated and interactive visual piece for a furniture company.

The goal of this project was to showcase different products where customers could save money on fantastic new looks for each room of their home.

This featured an interactive toggle where the user can see two dedicated styles of a room, and inspect each piece of furniture available for more information about them - linking them to discount codes for these products.

The build had to have a feel of elegance and was engaging for customers to use, giving them the sense that something amazing was right around the corner.

This serves as a great example of some bespoke work I used to carry out for specific clients who wanted to extend their existing website by adding some interactive projects for people to play around with, but also served to integrate with their business models.

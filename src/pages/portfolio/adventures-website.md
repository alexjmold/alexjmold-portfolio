An elegant website for an above and beyond adventure holiday company.

The main purpose of this project was to overhaul their existing dated website to reflect who they are as a company and give a real sense of what customers could expect from booking a holiday through them.

Offering many different types of luxury adventure holidays, the way everything interacted and animated had to align with this tone of voice. From the larger animations right down to the micro interactions, it had to just "feel right" for the company.

In terms of the technologies used, I ended up writing custom themeing for their existing CMS as they didn't want to move from it (WordPress). I connected this with a few small JavaScript libraries for some interaction and form services to keep the load times quick as it's a very media heavy site. Many of the animations are done using CSS (SCSS compiled).

The site implements custom caching for videos and images in order to display vast amounts of media without the wait, and allows potential customers to get a real sense of what the company can offer them.
